                Known as "Murabaha" and considered as the most common finance
                tool as a clear practical solution for buying different goods.
                The bank buys the product requested by the client from supplier,
                then, resells it to the client for installments after adding the
                profit of the bank to the gross selling price. The parties of
                "Murabaha" are three: Seller, Buyer and The Bank.
              </p>
              <h6 class="px-5">"Murabaha" Contract Basis</h6>
              <p class="p-3">
                ​"Murabaha" contract depends on two factors, promise "Wa'd" and
                credit sale. The client promises to buy a specific commodity and
                he will be committed to fulfill his promise, where the bank
                sells the commodity to the client in credit according to his
                promise.
              </p>
              <p class="px-5">
                As an example, if a client wants to purchase a car worth 20,000
                USD, the process will be as follows:
              </p>
              <p class="px-3">
                1. The client should get a price quotation from the cars agency
                for 20,000 USD value and present it to the bank.
              </p>
              <p class="px-3">
                2. The client promises the bank to buy the car for 24,000 USD
                and repay its value by monthly installments for 5 years
                according to credit sales formula.

              Known as "Mosawamah", it's similar to "Murabaha" with main
              difference that the bank doesn’t disclose the price it paid to
              product supplier. The bank chooses this type of contracts when
              commodity cost cannot be disclosed for any reason.

              In lease to own service, the client pays specific amount of money
              monthly for utilizing a specific product for a specific period of
              time. At the end of the leasing term, the client has the right to
              return the product or own it by paying its market value on that
              time or to take the product as a gift taking in consideration the
              amounts paid during leasing period. Parties of "Ijarah" contract
              are lessor, bank and lessee.

            <h6 class="px-3">Basis of "Ijarah" Contract</h6>
            <p class="px-3">
              This tool is a mix of "Sharea’a" contracts consists of buying
              promise from the client, credit sale contract from the bank and a

              For example, when a client wants to lease a car for 15,000 USD
              using "Ijarah", he/she will get a price quotation from the car
              owner and deliver it to the bank. The client promises the bank to
              lease the car paying determined monthly lease for 5 years.
            </p>
            <p class="px-3">
              The bank buys the car from the owner and pays its value in cash.

              The bank leases the car to the client according to agreed monthly
              installments and determined period. At the end of leasing period
              the bank sends a quotation to the client to buy the car. If the
              bank promised to transfer the car ownership to the client, then
              the bank is committed to fulfill its promise as the client has
              paid all payments.

              other hand, is a shareholder in the asset. All the returns from
              "Sukuk" are either profit from the investment or rental returns
              from issuer's properties. There are many forms from Skuk, some of
